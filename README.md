# FinalProject_Govt670

This repository contains my final submission for Govt670: Introduction to Applied Political Data Science.

The project is essentially an exploratory data analysis of the "Varieties of Democracy" data-set, which utilises machine learning techniques such as variable selection, decision trees and random forests, to reduce the over 4000+ indicators included in the data-set in order to find the most important set of predictors/determinants of variation in political corruption in Malaysia. 

To access the data requried for this analysis, please use the following google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S8VdkC7a0IfHzqyoUkV9ORWfm6rJUpQk?usp=sharing

The data can also be found directly from the VDem Institute using this link: https://www.v-dem.net/en/data/data/v-dem-dataset-v111/

Please note that users should place the .rds file into a subfolder within the project named "Data". Alternatively, the entire folder in the drive could be downloaded as is into the main project folder. This will allow the .rmd to run/knit without any alteration of the code. 

Should there be any inquiries, please direct them to az8465a@student.american.edu or alifiskandarzabidi@gmail.com
