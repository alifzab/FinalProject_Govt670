abstract = {[...]Peter Mumford, the Asia director of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, argues that there is a limit to how far the new prime minister will go to tackle corruption. Timeline 1981 Mahathir Mohamad becomes prime minister for the first time 1993 Anwar Ibrahim appointed deputy PM 1998 Mahathir sacks Anwar, has him arrested and he is subsequently convicted of corruption and sodomy 2003 Mahathir steps down as PM and is replaced by Abdullah Badawi 2004 Anwar is released from prison 2009 Najib Razak replaces Abdullah as PM and later sets up 1MDB 2015 Anwar jailed again after second sodomy conviction 2016 Anwar and Mahathir start reconciliation talks 2018 May — Mahathir elected as PM and frees Anwar, while putting Najib under investigation for corruption The opposition’s anti-graft campaign message was popular because it linked anger at the high cost of living and wide social inequality to the alleged excesses of the Najib administration.In particular, Pakatan Harapan promised to abolish the 6 per cent goods and services tax introduced by Mr Najib in 2015, to praise from international economists who believed it was wise for the government to diversify its revenue base away from oil production. The co-founder and editor-in-chief of Malaysiakini, a respected subscription-funded news website, has faced countless legal actions, including being sued by former prime minister Najib Razak and prosecuted for publishing “offensive” content. To get less biased coverage of the election, many Malaysians turned to Malaysiakini and other independent outlets including The Edge, or took advantage of the use of Facebook and Twitter by the then opposition parties. Since Mr Mahathir’s election victory, journalists for Malaysia’s mainstream newspapers like the New Straits Times and The Star have been freed to cover the story as they please.},

    abstract = { Despite its laudable roles in steering the process of socioeconomic development, government bureaucracy in Malaysia has not escaped public criticisms for its inefficiency, corruption, and failure to guard public interests. The media, civil society groups, intelligentsia, and the political opposition have successfully utilized the major scandals to highlight the growing public concern over the poor performance of the bureaucracy and its lack of accountability and responsiveness. This has provided impetus for the “clean and efficient government” movement initiated in the early 1980s and a series of subsequent efforts aimed at promoting appropriate values and ethics among public officials. Numerous rules and regulations have been framed, major reforms have been introduced in various spheres of administration, and an extensive program of training and bureaucratic reorientation has been undertaken. Despite all this, recent evidence suggests that the public service continues to suffer from problems of corruption and other irregularities. Obviously, the performance of numerous reforms in public service and the institutional mechanisms put in place for tackling ethical problems, though positive in general, has fallen short of expectations. This paper seeks to examine and analyze the present approach to combating corruption and promoting accountability in the Malaysian public service. In particular, it focuses on institutional mechanisms currently available and identifies and analyzes their constraints and limitations in keeping the public bureaucracy under surveillance and control. }
